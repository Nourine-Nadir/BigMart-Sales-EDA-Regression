# BigMart-Sales-EDA-Regression
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting BigMart sales using machine learning techniques. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and building a Ridge regression model. The trained model is saved as a .pkl file for future use.

## Project Details
Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The notebook begins with loading and exploring the dataset, handling missing values, and cleaning the data. Various statistical analyses and visualizations provide valuable insights into the characteristics of the dataset.

### Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a crucial step to enhance the predictive power of the model. The notebook demonstrates how to create new features and transform existing ones to improve the model's performance.

### Model Building
A Ridge regression model is chosen for its ability to handle multicollinearity in the dataset. The notebook explores hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation and evaluates the model's performance on both training and test sets.

### Model Evaluation and Interpretation
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used as the evaluation metric. The notebook visualizes the distribution of target values and the model's predictions, providing a clear understanding of the model's performance.
